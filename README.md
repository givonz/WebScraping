Web Scraping for Medical Research

This repository (will) contains many files related to an ongoing medical research that involves studying the medicinal use of herbs.  The goal is to use homeopathic drug provings (testings) as a base, to define which diseases and symptoms herbs will treat effectively.  Then, to correlate what chemicals and medicines are in these herbs.  Then, to correlate those medicines to the diseases being treated.  The ultimate goal is to come up with a nutritional therapy plan for various diseases.

The computer skills and languages demonstrated in throughout this project are Python 3.0, BeautifulSoup 3, SQL, SQL Server Management Studio, Ubuntu, file conversion/import, file indexing and more.

This is an ongoing project and files are added as completed.  As this is a work in process, not all program files operate correctly or completely.
